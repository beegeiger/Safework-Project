# The SafeWork Project

The SafeWork Project is a sex worker support web app designed to help provide sex workers resources in an increasingly difficult and dangerous environment.

Currently located at safeworkproject.org

### Update: The SafeWork Project 2.0 no longer live. It includes a feature called "SafeWalk Alerts" which can send automatic safety alerts to family/friends if a worker misses a check-in, which has now been broken off into the "BeSafe" Project Repository.
